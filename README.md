#MorphPlay

MorphPlay is a playful, scent-based installation that explores memory, attachment, and the limits of intimacy in an algorithmic age. At its center is a plush bunny that ‚Äúsniffs‚Äù you and generates whimsical, memory-like descriptions ‚Äî blending scent, projection, and storytelling. It‚Äôs part toy, part emotional experiment, and all about connection.

‚ú® Concept

MorphPlay started as an exploration of how scent evokes memory and emotional attachment. The first prototype generated quirky, generic interactions by randomly selecting from a database of scent-based memories.

Later, the project evolved to question how technology simulates personalization: the second prototype added color detection using ML5.js, allowing the bunny to identify the user‚Äôs clothing color and generate a corresponding scent description.

This shift revealed the eerie ways algorithmic systems approximate identity and intimacy ‚Äî mimicking care while flattening individuality.
