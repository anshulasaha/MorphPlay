#MorphPlay

MorphPlay is a playful, scent-based installation that explores memory, attachment, and the limits of intimacy in an algorithmic age. At its center is a plush bunny that “sniffs” you and generates whimsical, memory-like descriptions — blending scent, projection, and storytelling. It’s part toy, part emotional experiment, and all about connection.

✨ Concept

MorphPlay started as an exploration of how scent evokes memory and emotional attachment. The first prototype generated quirky, generic interactions by randomly selecting from a database of scent-based memories.

Later, the project evolved to question how technology simulates personalization: the second prototype added color detection using ML5.js, allowing the bunny to identify the user’s clothing color and generate a corresponding scent description.

This shift revealed the eerie ways algorithmic systems approximate identity and intimacy — mimicking care while flattening individuality.
